Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription based service or business. Use historical customer data, including
features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try
algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient
Boosting to predict churn.

Customer churn is the phenomenon in which a client stops doing business with an entity. Users can stop using a company’s product or service for a variety of reasons, such as affordability, dissatisfaction with the offering, and bad customer service.

More often than not, customers who churn from one company will start doing business with their competitor. For instance, if you aren’t happy with your current mobile service provider due to slow Internet speed, you are likely to switch to an alternative.

The act of churning isn’t one that happens suddenly. If you experience low network bandwidth, you are likely to tolerate it for a month or two. During this period, you would probably contact customer support, check your network speed, and leave a review on social media expressing your dissatisfaction.

If the data scientists at your current provider can collect this data and ascertain that your behavior is similar to that of other customers who have churned in the past, they will immediately alert the marketing team, who will then reach out to you and attempt to cater to your needs in the best way possible. They may provide you with special promotions, upgrade your plan, and work on creating a satisfactory user experience for you to prevent you from leaving.

Customer churn prediction is one of the most popular use cases of data science in marketing. Companies incur a lot of costs when users churn since it is expensive to replace an existing customer. Due to this, most mid to large-sized organizations will have some sort of churn prediction mechanism in place.

For subscription-based companies like Netflix and Spotify, it is crucial to retain existing customers since the entire business model relies on plan renewals. If you would like to work as a data scientist for companies like these in the future, it is a good idea to learn about techniques such as customer churn prediction. 

You can build a churn prediction model and showcase it on your resume, as this is a use case that is relevant to almost every organization and will help your portfolio stand out amongst other data science candidates.

In this article, we will show you how to build a customer churn prediction model in Python using the random forests algorithm.
